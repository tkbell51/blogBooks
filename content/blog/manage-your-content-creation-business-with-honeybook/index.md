Getting paid for creative work can take much work for content creators. Finding clients or customers willing to pay for their work is one of the hardest things they have to do. Many people who make content must put in a lot of time and work to build a following and become known as experts in their field. Even if they get a lot of fans, they may still need help making enough money to keep their business going.

Another area for improvement is coming up with contracts that protect their intellectual property and ensure they get paid. Many people who make content have to deal with billing and scheduling, which can take time away from creating content. Also, setting prices can be tricky. Content creators need to find a way to price their work that makes money and is competitive, which can be difficult because they have to find a balance between how valuable their work is and how much potential clients can afford to pay for their services.

Marketing and advertising are also significant problems. Content creators need to reach more people to make money from their work. You'll need good marketing and promotion strategies to get potential clients and customers.
Lastly, it can take a lot of work to keep track of your expenses and income for tax purposes. Freelancers and independent content creators have to handle their own money, which can be difficult and time-consuming.
